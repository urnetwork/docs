# Update 1

We launched a major update this month. We rebranded to URnetwork ([https://ur.io](https://ur.io)) with a new look and app. URnetwork is now free, with a supporter subscription. Our economic model was updated to reflect a new subsidy payout, which is paid to people who provide capacity to the network. We also launched Android TV support. We're building a new type of internet infrastructure, and simplifying the product was an important step.

We made a few changes to the site to streamline our organization:
- [docs.ur.io](https://docs.ur.io) Documentation backed by the [docs repo] on GitHub.
- [feedback.ur.io](https://feedback.ur.io) Product suggestions and feedback. This is a public site for structured feedback on the product.
- [support@ur.io](mailto:support@ur.io) Support has been moved to email. This simplifies for us, where we may link out to documentation, GitHub issues for bugs or improvements, or feedback for other feedback.
- [our Discord](https://bringyour.com/discord) Chat us here about technical or product discussion. This is a way to connect with the team building URnetwork. We're on pretty much every day.

What's next? Update 2 will be focused entirely on iOS and payout improvements.
