# URnetwork

> URnetwork is a decentralized VPN where egress capacity is provided by anyone who wants to participate in the network. It is built on peer-to-peer web standards with end-to-end TLS encryption, a contract-based economic model, and trust-and-safety defaults that keep providers safe. The main network space is operated by BringYour, Inc.

URnetwork connects users to a global network of egress providers — access points to localized internets around the world. Traffic from the network is designed to be indistinguishable from normal internet traffic. The network is free to use with a data cap; users can become a supporter for a higher data cap and priority speeds.

The API lives at `https://api.bringyour.com`. The connect protocol server is at `connect.bringyour.com`. The public extender server is at `extender.bringyour.com`.
