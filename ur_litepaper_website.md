# $UR — The Short Version

Every VPN asks you to trust them. URnetwork doesn't. Instead of routing your traffic through one company's servers, URnetwork splits it across thousands of independent providers worldwide. No single provider sees who you are and what you're doing. The architecture makes spying pointless. That's not a policy — it's physics.

The $UR token makes this network run. Users and enterprises pay for bandwidth. That money buys $UR on the open market. Providers earn $UR for contributing capacity. Every transaction permanently removes 2.5% of the tokens used from circulation. The heavier the network gets used, the scarcer the token becomes. There are one billion $UR tokens. They all exist today. No more will ever be created.

Most crypto infrastructure projects print new tokens to pay their contributors. This works until it doesn't — and it always stops working. Token prices fall, emissions increase to compensate, prices fall faster, the network dies. We watched it happen to project after project. $UR is designed to avoid that entirely. Rewards come from real usage fees, not a money printer. Providers stake tokens for better rewards. Users stake for discounts. Both sides lock supply because it's worth more to them inside the network than outside it.

URnetwork isn't a whitepaper. It's a live product. Real users pay real money. Contributors earn USDC today — $UR replaces that with decentralized, scalable rewards. Enterprise clients connect through standard contracts and never touch a wallet. The network spans 100+ countries. The protocol is open source. The trust and safety system protects providers at the protocol level so anyone can participate safely.

$UR launches on Solana at a $30M fully diluted valuation — seed-stage pricing for a production network. Every comparable privacy token trades between $25M and $35M after crashing 90% from launch. We're starting where they ended up. That's the point. We'd rather build wealth with our community than extract it from them. Privacy is a fundamental right. $UR is how ownership works.
