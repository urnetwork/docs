        Bring Your, LLC
        2261 Market Street #5245
        San Francisco, CA 94114

    b.  A party may change the address or phone numbers set out above for
        purposes of notice under this contract by giving written notice to
        the other party or parties hereto of such change in the same manner
        as is provided above.


12. Default. Default under this Agreement is a
    failure to comply with a material term or condition hereof. In the
    event of a default, the non-defaulting party may give the other
    party written notice specifying the default and the defaulting party
    shall have ten (10) days thereafter in which to cure same. If the
    default is by Customer, and not timely cured, Provider may; (i),
    terminate service to Customer and retain all prepaid amounts,
    or (ii) interrupt the Service until the default is cured with no
    refund of any prepaid amounts. In addition, Provider may also
    declare due and demand immediate payment of, any installments
    remaining unpaid, with interest thereon at the rate of (18%) per
    annum from the date of default in payment thereof until fully and
    finally paid, along with reasonable attorney's fees, court costs or
    other expenses it may incur in enforcing this Agreement. If this
    Agreement is terminated by mutual agreement or, if Provider fails to
    cure a noticed default, Customer's sole remedy is to cancel any
    subscription through the applicable Application Store. Failure to
    declare any default immediately upon occurrence, or a delay in
    taking any action in connection therewith, shall not waive such
    default nor any legal right or privilege to take action at any time
    thereafter. Termination of service by Provider does not relieve
    Customer of existing debts or obligations pursuant to this
    Agreement.

13. Export Regulation. The Application may be
    subject to US export control laws, including the Export Control
    Reform Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly
    or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Application to, or
    make the Application accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to
    which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or
    regulation. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws,
    regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings
    (including obtaining any necessary export license or other
    governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing,
    or otherwise making the Application available outside the US.

    which is not reasonably within the control of the parties and
    which by the exercise of due diligence could not reasonably be
    prevented or overcome. Events reasonably within the control of the
    party having the difficulty shall not constitute "force majeure"
    and shall be remedied with the exercise of due diligence. This
    paragraph does not apply to payments due under this Agreement.

    indemnify, defend, and hold us (including our affiliates,
